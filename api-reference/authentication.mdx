All LongShot API's requires the Bearer Token or Secret Token to authenticate requests.

LongShot API uses a customized Bearer Token to authenticate a user request during setup. 

This exclusive Bearer or Secret Token carries various privileges, so keep them secure and do not share it in publicly accessible areas like GitHub, client-side code, etc.

Authentication to the APIs is performed via HTTP Basic Auth.

Provide your Secret token on all your API requests, and you're good to go.

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer <Secret_token>'
```

## Things to Note

To authenticate via bearer auth (e.g., for a cross-origin request), use -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc" instead of just sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc.

The Bearer authentication scheme was created as part of OAuth 2.0 in RFC 6750 but is sometimes used independently. Similarly to Basic authentication, Bearer authentication should only be used over HTTPS (SSL).

Note: All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.
